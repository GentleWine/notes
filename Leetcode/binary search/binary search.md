# Binary Search

### 1482

##### confusion 

​	I couldn't understand the correctness of  function "canMake" because of its neglect for some subarray situations. But now, I find its reasonability since we don't need to consider all cases just to return the minimum number of days. 

##### conclusion

​	Actually, this problem is not so difficult itself to deal with except its control of upper limit and lower limit of binary search algorithm. The most significant think I got is to judge the terminal state.

##### highlight

​	To deal with sequence problems alike, we can use binary search. <u>Here we considered an increasing function of days as a sequence</u>.
